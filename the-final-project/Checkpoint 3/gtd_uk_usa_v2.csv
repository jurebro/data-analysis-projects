This incident was one in a series of 11 luxury home arsons in the Phoenix area between April 2000 and January 2001. In June 2001, confessed eco-terrorist, Mark Warren Sands was indicted for eight of the arson incidents, pled guilty, and in 2002, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for torching seven luxury homes under construction.

However, during the Federal Grand Jury indictment, prosecutors maintained that Sands committed the acts for his own twisted reasons and the he fabricated letters and claims from the CSP to carry out his plot.  Sands still maintained that he was against development of preserved areas, but also that he ""knew how to sell it,"" ""knew what a god media story was, and ""there was a sense of power"" behind the string of incidents that the media fed on.  The true motives appear to be a combination of personal reasons and to make a broader environmental message, but they remain unknown.

Lee also had a second starter pistol on him as he held the hostages for four hours as negotiators spoke with him. Lee was motivated by his disapproval of the Discovery network's television programming and in his manifesto on the internet, he laid out 11 demands for the network to change it's programming to focus on sterilization and infertility of humans rather than showcasing overpopulation, and Lee viewed the shows to be doing little to save the planet.
